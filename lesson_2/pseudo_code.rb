# Practice with pseudo code

- A method that returns the sum of two integers

- assign ingeter1 to a variable
- assign integer2 to a variable
 - Add the two ingeters together
- return the sum of the two integers

- A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

- iterate through the array of strings
	- connect all of the strings together
- return a concatenated string

- A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

- iterate through the array of integers
	- keep every other array element
	- remove the element before and after each element
- return a new array
